First thing to do:
git clone git@github.com:hajimetada/finalproject.git

Project Guideline:

Here is what we proposed to Jamie:
  "Our basic concept is to build a website which provides users valuable data (crime rate, average education, etc.) when they need to decide which area/neighborhood to live. Its functionality would be:
    1. a user choose area/neighborhood
    2. returns values (such as crime rate) of that neighborhood and Chicago overall
    3. draws a graph which describe the trend of 2
    4. (Hopefully) plots dots on neighborhood map

  Our source is from Chicago crime data (2001-)(the one we used in the first assignment) and census data.
