Project Guideline:

Here is what we proposed to Jamie:
  "Our basic concept is to build a website which provides users valuable data (crime rate, average education, etc.) when they need to decide which area/neighborhood to live. Its functionality would be:<br />
    1. a user choose area/neighborhood<br />
    2. returns values (such as crime rate) of that neighborhood and Chicago overall<br />
    3. draws a graph which describe the trend of 2<br />
    4. (Hopefully) plots dots on neighborhood map<br />

  Our source is from Chicago crime data (2001-)(the one we used in the first assignment) and census data.
