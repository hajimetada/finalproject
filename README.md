Project Guideline:
https://harris-ippp.github.io/

Here is what we proposed to Jamie:
  "Our basic concept is to build a website which provides users valuable data (crime rate, average education, etc.) when they need to decide which area/neighborhood to live. Its functionality would be:_
    1. a user choose area/neighborhood_
    2. returns values (such as crime rate) of that neighborhood and Chicago overall_
    3. draws a graph which describe the trend of 2_
    4. (Hopefully) plots dots on neighborhood map_

  Our source is from Chicago crime data (2001-)(the one we used in the first assignment) and census data.
